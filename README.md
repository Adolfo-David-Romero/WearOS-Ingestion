WearOS Ingestion Prototype
==========================

This WearOS application was initially developed to test the **sensor ingestion process** of the **Google Pixel Watch**, including gathering real-time health and activity data from onboard sensors. Over time, it evolved into a **prototype focused on supporting older adults** through wearable technology, emphasizing accessibility, simplicity, and real-world sensor usage.

üß† Project Overview
-------------------

The goal of this app is twofold:

1.  **Sensor Ingestion Testing**

    -   Validate and explore how sensor data is captured and handled on WearOS (e.g., heart rate, steps, motion).

    -   Understand limitations, sampling rates, and power considerations on the Pixel Watch.

2.  **Care-Focused Prototyping**

    -   Experiment with features that could aid **older individuals** in daily health monitoring and activity tracking.

    -   Lay the groundwork for use cases like **fall detection**, **health trends**, or **caregiver alerts**.

‚úÖ Features
----------

-   Real-time sensor data collection from WearOS sensors

-   Logging and visualization of incoming data

-   Optimized for the **Google Pixel Watch**

-   Early considerations for accessibility and user-centered design for older adults

üì± Target Platform
------------------

-   **WearOS 3.0+**

-   Tested on **Google Pixel Watch**

üì¶ Installation
---------------

Clone the repository and build the project using **Android Studio**:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adolfo-David-Romero/WearOS-Ingestion.git
```

Make sure your development environment supports **WearOS development** and you have an emulator or a physical watch device connected.

üìç Future Directions
--------------------

-   Integration with a connected **caregiver app** for remote monitoring

-   Fall detection or inactivity alerts

-   More intuitive UI tailored for seniors

-   Cloud sync for historical health data

üôå Acknowledgements
-------------------

This project is part of ongoing experimentation with **wearable tech for elder care** and **remote patient monitoring (RPM)**. Feedback, ideas, and collaborators are welcome!
